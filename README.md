### Step 1: Create a Discord Application

2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Navigate to the "Bot" tab and click "Add Bot"
4. Under the "TOKEN" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot token
5. Save this token for later use
6. Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable both "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" and "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT"
7. Under the "OAuth2" tab, select "bot" in the scopes section
8. In the bot permissions section, select:
   - Read Messages/View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Embed Links
   - Read Message History
   - Use Slash Commands
9. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to add the bot to your server

### Step 2: Get Your Pterodactyl API Key

1. Login to your Pterodactyl panel (e.g., https://mc.bloom.host)
2. Go to Account Management (bottom left corner of your dashboard)
3. Select the "API Credentials" tab
4. Create a new API key
5. Save this API key for later use

### Step 3: Set Up the Bot

1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   PTERODACTYL_API_KEY=your_pterodactyl_api_key_here
   ```
4. Update the configuration in `index.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Configuration
   const API_URL = "https://your.pterodactyl.panel/api"; // Update with your panel URL
   const SERVER_ID = "your_server_id"; // Update with your server ID
   const MAX_RAM_GB = 12; // Update with your server's RAM allocation
   ```

### Step 4: Start the Bot

Run the bot using:
```bash
node index.js
```

For production use, consider using a process manager like PM2:
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start index.js --name "minecraft-discord-bot"
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Shows current server status, including RAM/CPU usage and player count |
| `/restart` | Initiates a vote to restart the server with a configurable timeout |
| `/cancel` | Cancels an ongoing restart vote |
| `/force-restart` | Forces an immediate server restart (Admin only) |

## Customization

You can customize various settings in the `index.js` file:

- `VOTE_TIMEOUT`: Duration in seconds for restart votes (default: 60)
- `MAX_RAM_GB`: Maximum RAM allocation for your server (default: 12)
- `STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to update the bot's status (default: 60000ms)

## Troubleshooting

- **API Connection Issues**: Ensure your API URL is correct and your API key has the proper permissions
- **Bot Not Responding**: Check if your Discord token is correct and that the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server
- **Command Registration Failed**: Restart the bot after adding it to a new server
